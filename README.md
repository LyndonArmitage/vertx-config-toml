# Vert.x 3 TOML Config Support

This project aims to provide support for the 
[TOML configuration file format](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml) to 
the [Vert.x Config project](https://github.com/vert-x3/vertx-config).

Currently it does this by loosely wrapping around the 
[toml4j library](https://github.com/mwanji/toml4j) so any problems with parsing
are likely within that project.

There is currently a [Pull Request](https://github.com/vert-x3/vertx-config/pull/57) 
on the main vertx-config project for this as a feature.
Once merged this project will be archived and unsupported.
